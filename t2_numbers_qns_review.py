# Example:
# Enter first number: 5.5
# Enter second number: 1.5
# Addition results: 7.0
# Substraction results: 4.0
# Multiplication results: 8.25
# Division results (first number / second number): 3.6666666666666665

# Note: 
# 5.5 and 1.5 in first and second number can be any number, depending on a user's input.
# The arithmetic results are the output of the program based on the values of first and second number.
